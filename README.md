This is a readme for gh-issues-migrator.py

Relevant information will go here.

Here's the migration logic.

1) Get a list of all milestones, labels, and issues from the source repository.
2) Get a list of all milestones and labels from the target repository.
3) Any milestones and labels that exist in the source and do not exist in the
target, recreate in the target.
